 Description

Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is one of the most popular model reduction techniques for nonlinear partial differential equations. It is based on a Galerkin-type approximation, where the POD basis functions contain information from a solution of the dynamical system at pre-specified time instances, so-called snapshots.
